<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<p>Nowadays, shopping online is an essential part of shopping, big and small companies or stores
need to have its commercial website, any serious business can`t be improved and reached all
over the world unless it has a website, even most families, clubs and pet snakes do, too. This
system is designed for a hardware shop. The client needed to put their products online using a
website. This document is prepared to present the requirements of the project. Both functional
and Non-functional requirements are described in detail in this document. The main purpose of
the project is to make a strong connection between our client and his customers using a
web-based platform. This will help the customers also for finding the products they want easily</p>


<h1>Scope of Development Project</h1>

<p>This online system is designed for the hardware shop to interact with the customers easily. All
the products that are available in the hardware are added to the website and their quantity.
Therefore the system can be used as a store management system for the hardware. And also
customers can see all the products that are available in the shop and they can decide whether they
place an order or not.
We hope that the hardware shop will be able to get closer to the customers through this system
and will be able to give better service and convenience to them as a better business that is using
the latest technology.
This online system will not only offer convenience to its users but will add value over the regular
hardware store by offering product specifications, quality certificates, product usage
recommendations, correct product usage instructions, technical support, and many other features
that will keep the home builders of today and tomorrow better informed in purchasing hardware
goods in building their dream homes.</p>
